	<p>The ‘information paradox’
		Building on the foundations laid by Albert Einstein in his groundbreaking theory of relativity, Hawking used quantum theory to contend that in the cold depths of space black holes emit heat and slowly contract until they no longer exist.
		Hawking’s theory suggested that the information in objects entering a black hole would disappear and be lost forever. This contradicted a basic law of quantum mechanics, which demands that information relating to an object is never lost, and gave rise to “the information paradox”.
		The new research explains how at least some information could be preserved once a black hole disappears. As an object enters a black hole, the temperature increases and raises the entropy level – a measure of an object’s internal disorder.
		A sheen of photons surrounding a black hole’s event horizon – the point at which light cannot escape the extreme gravitational pull – may record the hole’s entropy. The research centres on how the protons, known as “soft hair”, store information associated with entropy.
		The paper represents a step towards solving the information paradox, but there is still work to be done. Physicists must now determine how information associated with entropy is stored in soft hair and how the information escapes a black hole when it evaporates.
		“Understanding the microscopic origin of this entropy – what are the underlying quantum states that the entropy counts? – has been one of the great challenges of the last 40 years,” Marika Taylor, professor of theoretical physics at Southampton University in the UK, who studied under Hawking, told the Guardian.</p>
